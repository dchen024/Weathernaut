## Step 2b: Evaluate ideas
### 1.  Weathernaut

**Description**: This app would allow the user to keep track of the weather at their current location or other location that they are interested in.

**Category:** Utility

**Mobile**: This app will be designed to make it easy to get all your weather data in nice compact format on the go and at any time.

**Story**: Imagine wanting to go outside but you don't know what the weather looks like. Weathernaut will quickly inform you of the weather at your fingertips.

**Market**: Everyone can benefit from using this app because everyone needs to know what the weather is like for their location before going outside.

**Habit**: This app would be opened and used everytime a person wanted to go outside or make plans, as it is very important to know what the weather is like outside before making any plans or going outside. The average user would just use this app to know what the weather will be like.

**Scope**: V1 would be pretty straightforward and only contain the weather and temperature of a single location that is specified by the user. V2 would add the ability to add and save multiple locations weather and temperature for easy viewing. V3 would make the app more visually appealing.


### 2.  PlantPal

**Description**:Allows plant lovers and newcomers to have a easier time to taking care of their plants. It reminds them to take care of the plants when it is time to to ensure that the plant stays healthy.

**Category:** Productivity

**Story**: More people will be interested in gardening and plant care as a way to connect with nature, and it could also have a social aspect, allowing user to share their progress with connection or other plant users.

**Market**: This app would be perfect for plant lovers and people who are interested in learning more about plants. This app would help them that process easier, because it helps them learn about the plant and also when to water their plant to ensure that the plant stays healthy.

**Habit**: The user would be checking the app when they want to look when they should water the plant next to help the plant get enough water but not overflowing with water. If the user has a couple of plants they might check once a day but if the user has multiple plants they would check multiple time of days to make sure they properly taken care of the plant.

**Scope** : This app is quite technical as it involves either finding an api or finding software that will identify plants based on the camera. A stripped down version of this app would only include a reminder feature which would still require you to have an api of plants and how to care for them. This would be a interesting app to build even without the feature to identify plants using the camera.

### 3.  GasNow

**Description**: This app will be paired up with the user's vehicle and detect the amount of fuel or gas in the vehicle, in which case it will deliver gas if the vehicle does not have any or if it detects less fuel.

**Market** : Everyone can utilize this app to its full potential and benefit from its feature of being able to detect your location when gas is absent from the vehicle.

**Habit**: This app will be automated with the vehicle when fuel is low, and it will notify the user of the level of fuel. Thus, it will not be frequent or addictive; however, there needs to be a certain level of habit with this app.
